Software Engineering Immersive - Project 2 - Dota Dashboard

Project: Build a functional Dota Dashboard in a week.

Dota is a series of strategy video games now developed by Valve. The series began in 2003 with the release of Defense of the Ancients, a fan-developed multiplayer online battle arena mod for the video game Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion, The Frozen Throne.

This app will aim to be a simple dashboard for finding games from the professional scene.
